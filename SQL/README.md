## Requirements and Setup
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Workshop-Interactive-Approach-Learning/dp/1838642358/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The%20SQL%20Workshop&qid=1610708551&sr=8-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838642358&utm_term=SQL&utm_content=The%20SQL%20Workshop"><img src="https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/Workshop-Covers/blob/master/The%20SQL%20Workshop.png" alt="The SQL Workshop" height="360px" width="280px" align="right" this.target="_blank"></a>

To get started with the project files, you'll need to install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/)

Please note that the SCRIPTS directory has two subdirectories

* /MYSQL SCRIPTS
* /SQL SERVER SCRIPTS

Each of these subdirectories has two files. One file builds the appropriate PACKT ONLINE SHOP database structure - tables, columns, relations - for MySQL or SQL Server, and one file inserts MySQL or SQL Server data rows into the appropriate database structure.
